# Simple-project-2---Patient-History-and-medicine-record
This repository contains a simple java project



The pid, pname, history and medicines of each object will be also user defined as well.
Take these information before creating each object and initialize the instance variables of
the objects by calling the Patient(int pid, String pname, String history) constructor.
Also set all of the patientsâ€™ prescribed medicines by calling a setter method of the Patient
class. Finally print the medicines for all of the patients by using getter method of Student
class.
