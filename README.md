# Simple-project-2---Patient-History-and-medicine-record
This repository contains a simple java project



Suppose you have to develop a java class Patient for your client. Inside of the src package
there is a package named patients. The Patient class is located inside of the patients
package. The Patient class does have instance variables pid, pname, history and
medicines. The history data field contains the patients’ previous medical records. And the
medicines data field contains the prescribed medicines provided by a doctor. Your client
asked to keep history and medicines directly inaccessible from other classes. Those
variables have to be accessed by some String getter() and setter methods. The Patient
class also have two parameterized constructors [Patient(int pid, String pname),
Patient(int pid, String pname, String history)].
You also have to create a class named Main inside of the src package where you will be
writing the main method. Inside of the main method create an array of object of Patient
class. The number of objects will be user defined.

The pid, pname, history and medicines of each object will be also user defined as well.
Take these information before creating each object and initialize the instance variables of
the objects by calling the Patient(int pid, String pname, String history) constructor.
Also set all of the patients’ prescribed medicines by calling a setter method of the Patient
class. Finally print the medicines for all of the patients by using getter method of Student
class.
